CSS Variables = CSS custom properties
=====================

`Variables` are one of the most fundamental concepts in any programming language. A `variable is container/holder to store/hold the data/information` for future programming use or calculation purpose.

`Custom properties sometimes also referred to as CSS variables or Cascading variables` are nothing but entities that contain specific values to be reused/accessed throughout a document and saves lots of time while editing large/huge websites.

CSS variables set/defined/declared using custom property notation (e.g., `--base-color: black;`) and are accessed/called using the `var() function` (e.g., `background-color: var(--base-color);`).

1 Introduction to CSS Variables/Custom Properties
=====================

- CSS is static stylesheet language/mostly a declarative language, lacking in dynamic capabilities/Programming features-terminologies like variables, mixin, function, re-usable classes, etc.
- To overcome all CSS disadvantages and add advanced programming features-terminologies, earlier/in past we have used CSS pre-processors like `SASS` or `LESS`, but now a days it's possible to use those features in pure CSS with CSS3 advanced features i.e. Custom Properties

1.1. What are Variables
---------------------

- `Variables` are one of the most fundamental and important concepts in any programming language
- A variable is `container/holder to store/hold the data/information`
- A variable is a kind of data holder where we can store some value for future further programming use or calculation purpose
- A JavaScript variable is simply a `name of the storage location (named containers/named storage)` for data
- Variables are `symbolic names for values` 
- Variables are used to store data of different types like a `string` of text, `numbers`, `boolean` values like true/false, an `array` or `object` of data, etc. 
- The data or value stored in the variables can be `set`, `updated`, and `retrieved` whenever needed
- Variables let you store and update different values your program needs in order to perform some work
- Variables are declared using the keyword `var` keyword
- The `assignment operator (=)` is used to assign value to a variable, like this: `var varName = value;` or `var firstName = 'JavaScript';`
- **Example**: Variables are like `box or an envelope` which we use to `organize various kinds of stuff` and put a `label` on each box or an envelope
- **Example**: Variable declaration and assignment is just `like Maths & Algebra`: `x = 10`; and in JavaScript we write `var x = 10;`
> **Note**: Depending on programming language, the different assignment operator like `equal to =` or `colon :` is used to assign value to a variable
