CSS Variables = CSS custom properties
=====================

`Variables` are one of the most fundamental concepts in any programming language. A `variable is container/holder to store/hold the data/information` for future programming use or calculation purpose.

`Custom properties sometimes also referred to as CSS variables or Cascading variables` are nothing but an entities that contain specific values to be reused/accessed throughout a document and saves lots of time while editing large/huge websites.

CSS variables set/defined/declared using custom property notation (e.g., `--base-color: black;`) and are accessed/called using the `var() function` (e.g., `background-color: var(--base-color);`).
